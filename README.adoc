Reports memory usage of Linux processes, including USS, PSS, and RSS.

The memory metrics are defined as follows:

- USS - unique set size, the amount of memory unique to a process, i.e. not shared with any other process.
- PSS - proportional set size, the processâ€™s unshared memory plus a proportional share of memory shared with other processes.
- RSS - resident set size, the total memory resident in RAM for a process, including all private pages and all shared pages.

All values are shown in kilobytes and represent memory resident in RAM (not swapped).
